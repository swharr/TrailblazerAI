# TrailBlazer AI - Cursor Rules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Use "use client" directive only when necessary (prefer server components)
- Async/await over promises
- Descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop counters)

## React Patterns
- Co-locate related components
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use React Server Components by default
- Client components only for interactivity
- Proper loading and error states for all async operations

## Styling
- Tailwind utility classes (avoid custom CSS unless necessary)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use shadcn/ui components as base
- Consistent spacing (use Tailwind's scale: 4, 8, 16, 24, 32)
- Dark mode consideration in all components

## API Integration
- All API calls go through /app/api routes (no direct client calls to external APIs)
- Type all API responses
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Cost tracking on every model API call

## File Organization
- One component per file
- Export component as default
- Types defined in same file or /lib/types.ts if shared
- Utils in /lib/utils.ts

## Comments
- JSDoc for complex functions
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic only
- No commented-out code (use git history)

## Performance
- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize images (use Next.js Image component)
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Debounce user input for API calls
